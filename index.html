      Blatant aimbot escapee at slow motion. Sniper rifles generally require an open scope to hit accurately, and in this demo we can see that the cheater hits the enemy quickly and accurately and without opening the scope. Before the kill, the aimer quickly moves to the enemy's position, and after the shot is fired, the aimbot used artificially imitates the jerky movement of the mouse after a human presses the mouse. But as you can see, even in slow motion, the jiggle is still done within a frame, making it look ripped and unnatural.
